# Retail In Motion
Used KOIN for dependency injection

I'll admit it's the 1st time Ive done any unit testing on livedata but I seem to have it working. So at least I've learned something!

It's the 1st time I've processed XML responses - previoulsy it's always been JSON. 
I've used Retrofit and I've used SimpleXmlConverterFactory to transform the XML to a Kotlin class. It's marked as  deprecated, but works. 
Time allowing, I'll have a look at using something else.

On something more complex I'd have used View binding, but that seems unnecessary on something so small, so just used findviewbyId
